# clothstore model
**simple HTML CSS and JS static webpage**
> A static view of an cloth store with simple Javascript and CSS animantions.
This Website is totaly responsible and the interface as a shopbop clone.

# What is in this sample?

A entire site was maded with only four files, one json, one JS, one CSS and one HTML. Theres no code decopling, for me, its an entire mess.

# Whi i do that?

This project was made intended to work with API Consumption, Class Modeling, DOM manipulation, Event Binding and responsiveness.
The page consumns a json file simulating an API consumption, and then render this file informations on browser.

# What's out of this project?

The code decoupling was the first thing out. All the projects rules it's in an single file (bad practice by the way). But the intention here, its just to test some speed and response and to compare with the two other ways this project will be builded. You will see here, the layers of Business, Applicatoin, Presentation, and Data access in one single file (please don't be nauseated), but, for this project two new versions you will see the most modern architecture implemented on two frameworks to SPA.

# What's next?

Using the newest versions of the frameworks React and Angular, the project will present a solid SPA aplication with dependency injection, Class Modeling, API consumption, Event Binding and DOM manipulation. Follow my profile and see these projects and the benchmarks.

ðŸš€ See you soon!!!
